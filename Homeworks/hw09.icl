/*
Given the above defined abstract data type, record, and function:
you are given a task to expand functionality by making RoflCopter
a Complex.

Refactor the code, so we can multiply the new RoflCopter by an Int.

Definition: Refactor (verb)
"a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code,
altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.
Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations."

That is, make the code work, without changing the arguments of timesRofl.
You will need to change RoflCopter's definition, and the internal workings
of timesRofl.

Implement the Dictionary data type.
A dictionary is a list containing
pairings of two entries.
The first entry is the "key".
The second entry is the "value".
Every key has an value associated with it.
Keys are unique, there can not be duplicates.
Values can be duplicated between keys.
